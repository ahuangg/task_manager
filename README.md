# Task Manager

This Swift-built iOS application keeps you organized with a powerful task management system.  Add, update, and delete tasks directly on the main list or through a convenient calendar view.  No matter which view you choose, your tasks will always be reflected in both places.  The app also saves your tasks locally using UserDefaults, ensuring they're always accessible even if you're offline. With a user-friendly navigation bar, you can seamlessly switch between the list and calendar view to best suit your organizational needs.


The following functionality is completed:

-   [x] App displays a list of tasks
-   [x] Users can add tasks to the list
-   [x] Session persists when application is closed and relaunched (tasks dont get deleted when closing app)
-   [x] Note: You have to quit the app, not minimize it, in order to see the persistence.
-   [x] Tasks can be deleted
-   [x] Users have a calendar view via navigation controller that displays tasks
